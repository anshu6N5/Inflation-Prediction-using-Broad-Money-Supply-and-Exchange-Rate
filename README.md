# Inflation-Prediction-using-Broad-Money-Supply-and-Exchange-Rate

🧠 Objective:
This project explores the relationship between inflation, broad money supply, and exchange rate using a Linear Mixed Model (LMM), with country-level random effects to capture unobserved heterogeneity across nations.

✅ Key Findings:
The model achieves:

Conditional R² = 0.540 → The full model (with country-level effects) explains 54% of inflation variation.

Marginal R² = 0.002 → Fixed effects alone (broad money supply and exchange rate) explain only 0.2% of variation.

🔍 Interpretation:

This shows that inflation is heavily influenced by country-specific factors.

Variables like money supply and exchange rate alone are not sufficient to explain inflation universally.

📌 Performance Insight:
The model performs well for countries with stable to moderate inflation (0–30%).

As shown in the plot, predictions are closely aligned with actual inflation within this range.

However, for countries experiencing extremely high or hyperinflation, the model underperforms due to unaccounted factors like:

Fiscal policy

Political instability

Commodity price shocks (e.g., oil)

📷 Visualization:

Red Line: Best-fit line of actual vs. predicted inflation.

Green Line: Ideal 1:1 prediction.

Dots: Represent actual data points.
